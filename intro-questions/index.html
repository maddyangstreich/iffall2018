    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
    <h5> <i> by Maddy Angstreich for Interaction Foundations, Fall 2018</i></h5>
    <li>My name is Maddy Angstreich and I'm a junior studying Communication Design.</li> </br>
    <li>I'm interested in front end web development because it has the unique potential to combine layout, motion, and interaction. I also love creating a tangible solution to a problem. </li>  </br>
    <li>I took a Computer Science web development class last year, and have since then been watching free tutorials and teaching myself HTML &  Javascript with Superhi.</li>  </br>
    <li>I hope I can learn funky hover and scroll Javascript animations.</li>  </br>
    <li>I expect that flexible widths and screen sizes will make layout a new challenge.</li>  </br>
    <li>The <a href="https://designthinkers.com/Home"> Design Thinkers Conference </a> homepage has really beautiful and engaging scroll animation that focuses solely on great type and motion.</li>  </br>
    <li>The <a href="http://goodfortunestl.com/"> Good Fortune Restaurant </a> in St. Louis has a site that communicates very well because the scrollover effects on the text and appearing images clearly illuminate the viewer's choices.</li>  </br>
    <li>The <a href="http://beyondthispoint.design/"> Beyond This Point</a> podcast hosted by <i>Civlization</i> has beautiful scroll animation, and accessible and beautiful color and typographic choices.</li>  </br>
