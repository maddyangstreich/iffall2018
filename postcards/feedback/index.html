  <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      type may be too small to be legible
<li>use hanging quote marks to create an easier reading experience  </li>

  margins for text on the web version look random and inconsistent with the some of the clear margins on the mobile version.
</li>
<li>
  type color isnt legible on the 2nd mockups, try using white to be consistent with the other mockups and to contrast with the darker backgrounds
</li>
<li>
  using a serif connects well with the stoic subject matter, but this particular serif feels too illegible for web use at this size.
</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Structure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      the design’s visual priorities are the images rather than the text. by enlarging the type and using clearer margins you can help draw the reader into the type just as much as the images.
    </li>
    <li>
      the white type works well in contrast with the darker tones in the images
    </li>
    <li>
      As of now, the text boxes keep the text at short line lengths. it might be interesting to explore longer line lengths on the web mockups that then turn into shorter line lengths on the mobile mockups so there’s a sense of variability between the two browser widths
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      when the browser width increases and decreases, few things happen to the type. Rather than repositioning the type on the page like in the 2nd mockup, I would try keeping the type in the same general location for a more intuitive user experience. It would be odd to make the user jump around the page when the browser width changes sizes, so instead maybe just have the point size and line length change with the browser rather than the overall location on the page.
    </li>
    <li>
      the text usually is only colliding with the solid background colors of the images, which is nice for legibility.
    </li>
    <li>
      This seems very buildable!
    </li>
